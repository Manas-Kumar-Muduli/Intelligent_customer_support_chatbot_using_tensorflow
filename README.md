The project involves developing an intelligent customer support chatbot using Python, TensorFlow, and NLTK. The chatbot is trained on a JSON dataset containing various user intents, such as greetings, farewells, thanks, and queries. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to tokenize and lemmatize user input, creating a bag-of-words model for intent classification. The chatbot then predicts the user's intent using a pre-trained neural network model and responds with appropriate predefined replies. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning and NLP to create a responsive, automated customer support system.
